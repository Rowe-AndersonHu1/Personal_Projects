### This project isn't finished yet. I still need to finish the logic for the buttons

In this project, I re-made a web app that I created for a class. During the class, I used pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create this app, but now I'll be using React JS to see how much better the app performs and to compare the development processes between using ReactJS and just HTML, CSS, and Javasciprt. I have a repository for the original app on my account.
